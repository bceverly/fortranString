String class in Fortran 2008

The purpose of this repository is to capture the work I have done creating
a simple string class in Fortran 2008 along with the example program of
how to use it.  This is meant to demonstrate the new capabilities that
have been added to the language since FORTRAN IV or FORTRAN 77 that I was
more familiar with.
